# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

# Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 data from the Our World in Data dataset (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) using SQL queries. The analysis focuses on various aspects of the pandemic, including case numbers, death rates, vaccination progress, and comparisons across different locations and time periods.

# Key Features
- Data exploration using SQL queries in MySQL Workbench
- Analysis of total cases vs total deaths
- Examination of infection rates and death rates relative to population
- Comparison of COVID-19 impact across different countries and continents
- Investigation of vaccination progress over time
- Creation of views for data visualization

# Queries Included
- Basic data retrieval and sorting
- Calculation of death percentages for specific locations
- Analysis of case percentages relative to population
- Identification of locations with highest infection and death rates
- Continental analysis of death rates
- Joining of death and vaccination data for comprehensive analysis
- Creation of temporary tables and views for further analysis and visualization

# Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
- SQL (including advanced features like window functions, joins, and view creation)

This project demonstrates proficiency in SQL query writing, data analysis, and the ability to extract meaningful insights from large datasets.
